# Hello there! 
#
# We care about making our git history clean, maintainable and easy to access for
# all our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit
# messages:

#   <type>: <subject>
#
# Please note that:
# + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is providing.
#   Allowed types are:
#   * build: Build related changes (eg: npm related/ adding external dependencies)
#   * chore: A code change that external user won't see (eg: change to .gitignore file or .prettierrc file)
#   * feat: A new feature
#   * fix: A bug fix
#   * docs: Documentation related changes
#   * refactor: A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature. (eg: You can use this when there is semantic changes like renaming a variable/ function name)
#   * perf: A code that improves performance
#   * test: Adding new test or making changes to existing test
#
# + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in the following format:
